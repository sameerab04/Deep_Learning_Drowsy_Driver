# Deep Learning Drowsy Driver Detection

## Overview

The "Deep Learning Drowsy Driver Detection" project focuses on developing a deep learning-based system that detects whether a driver is drowsy by analyzing facial features, specifically the state of their eyes. This real-time system is designed to enhance road safety by alerting drivers who may be at risk of drowsiness-related accidents.

This project employs advanced deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and pre-trained architectures like YOLOv8 and EfficientNet, to achieve high accuracy in detecting drowsiness. The model's effectiveness is evaluated using various metrics, with a strong emphasis on real-time application and deployment.

## Problem Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop a deep learning system that can accurately detect drowsiness in drivers by analyzing their eye state in real-time. The system aims to reduce the risk of accidents caused by drowsy driving by providing timely alerts.

## Data Gathering

### Data Sources:

- **Video Data**: Collected from platforms like TikTok and YouTube, focusing on videos where driver eye states can be clearly observed.
- **Frame Extraction**: Frames were generated from the collected videos for further analysis and training.
- **Bounding Boxes**: Bounding boxes were created around the driverâ€™s eyes using Roboflow to provide the necessary data for training object detection models.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Dataset Overview:

- **Training Data**: 590 images
- **Validation Data**: 418 images
- **No Missing Values**: The dataset is complete, with no missing entries.

### Key Findings:

- **Histogram Analysis**: The distribution of bounding box sizes varies, with a slight right skew, indicating that most bounding boxes are relatively small.
- **Scatterplot Analysis**: Analyzed the relationship between x and y coordinates of bounding boxes, color-coded by width and height, providing insights into the spatial distribution of eye regions in images.

## Image Preprocessing

### Object Classification:

- **Image Conversion**: All images were converted to RGB format to standardize the input.
- **Resizing**: Images were resized to 244x244 pixels, preparing them for input into the CNN models.
- **Label Encoding**: Class labels (e.g., "Eyes Open," "Eyes Closed") were converted into integer format for classification tasks.

### Object Detection:

- **Aspect Ratio Maintenance**: Images were resized while maintaining the original aspect ratio to avoid distortion.
- **Bounding Box Adjustment**: Bounding boxes were recalculated to align with the resized image dimensions, ensuring accuracy in object detection.
